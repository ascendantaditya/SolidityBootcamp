# DVLPR Token

DVLPR Token is a basic ERC-20 compatible cryptocurrency implemented in Solidity. This token contract allows users to create, transfer, and manage the DVLPR tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Standard Compatibility**: The DVLPR token contract follows the ERC-20 standard, making it compatible with various wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts.
- **Token Name**: The name of the token is "DVLPR Token".
- **Token Symbol**: The symbol for the token is "DVLPR".
- **Decimals**: The token has 18 decimal places.
- **Initial Supply**: The initial token supply is determined during contract deployment and is allocated to the deploying address.
- **Transfer**: Users can transfer DVLPR tokens to other addresses.
- **Approve**: Users can approve other addresses to spend DVLPR tokens on their behalf.
- **TransferFrom**: Approved addresses can transfer DVLPR tokens on behalf of the token owner.

## Getting Started

To deploy the DVLPR token contract on the Ethereum blockchain, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Contract**: Use a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle) to compile the DVLPRToken.sol file.

2. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix, Truffle, or web3.js.

3. **Interact with the Contract**: Once deployed, interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts to create, transfer, and manage DVLPR tokens.

## Examples

Below are some examples of interacting with the DVLPR token contract:

- **Transfer Tokens**: Use the `transfer` function to transfer DVLPR tokens to another Ethereum address.
- **Approve Spending**: Use the `approve` function to approve another address to spend DVLPR tokens on your behalf.
- **Transfer Tokens From**: Use the `transferFrom` function to transfer DVLPR tokens from another address where you have been approved to spend tokens.
